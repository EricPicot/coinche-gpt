# Coinche R.O.

Coinche is a game card.

[Here](https://ibelote.com/en/rules-coinche.php) are the rules. The coinche is played between two teams of two players using a set of 32 classic cards (8 cards of each color - tile, clover, heart and spades). La Coinche is a strategic game similar to the Bridge. In Coinche, players must evaluate their hands and estimate the number of points they think they can reach in the game. Players make contracts and the ads have a major role in the game.

A round of Coinche could be divided into two distinct parts:
- First, given their hand, players propose a contrat (number of points to do + the suit)
- Secondly, the players play heigh tricks

## Objectif of the project

We want to apply Reinforcement Learning to Coinche. To begin, we'll focus on the second phase of a round. 
Players we'll be provided their eight cards' game and a contrat.
The AI player will then have to both learn the rules and some strategy
